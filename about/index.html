<h4>After seventeen semesters in art-school Lee finally recieved a BFA then spent a
  decade VJing (with Tsuyoshi Suzuki, Orbital, Aphex Twin, and
  GodSpeed You! Black Emperor) and making experimental documentaries
  about climate-change solutions. He has won awards for his paintings
  (Laureat du Quebec; CollegeArt '86), videos (Canadian Student Film
  Festival), and climate movies (EarthVision'98 in Santa Cruz). The
  Space In Between, Lee's paintings drawings and video chaos have
  recently been written about in "Tripping on nothing: placebo
  psychedelics and contextual factors" (published in Springer Nature
  2020) where they say his paintings make people as high as if they
