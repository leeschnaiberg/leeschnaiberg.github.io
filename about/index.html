<h1>Too brute to be fine too shrewd to be na&#239;ve</h1>

<br>
<h4>An outsider's outsider, Schnaiberg's first art teacher was his grandfather, who studied with Arthur Lismer then built an Art Brut collage 'salon' for over 20 years... 
<br>
<br>
After seventeen semesters in art-school [kicked out of some, quit some] Lee finally recieved a BFA.  Spent a decade VJing (Orbital, Aphex Twin, Tsuyoshi Suzuki, the live AV band Technopest and GodSpeed You! Black Emperor) and making experimental documentaries about climate-change solutions,  which led into a decade and a half making <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ho7K4CtScNsWCfXKWs4RESLg_9SvPB5HL1gaabpRffE/edit?usp=sharing">eco-capital sculptures using capital as the primary medium.</a> 
<br>
<br>
Since 2012 Lee has returned to the picture-plane both with his TSIB The Space In Between multimedia series, and his new abstract-expressionist and post-impressionist cellphone pantings.  
<br>
<br>
Lee has won awards for his paintings (Laureat du Quebec; CollegeArt '86), videos (Canadian Student Film Festival), and climate movies (EarthVision'98 in Santa Cruz). The Space In Between has recently been written about in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-020-05464-5?fbclid=IwAR2XPH2moPd53cH1mWwU-9eaAbrqaklUG86AVUvjscIwR-2JkpbZc2odQag">Tripping on nothing: placebo psychedelics and contextual factors</a> (published in Springer Nature 2020) where they imply his paintings make people as high as if they ate mushrooms.  </h4>
